# Welcome to FillMyShip
# FillMyShip Project Evolution Journey

An interactive visualization showcasing the development journey of FillMyShip - a platform connecting cargo mediators with businesses for transparent shipping solutions.

## üö¢ About FillMyShip

FillMyShip aims to consolidate cargo shipping mediators onto a single platform, similar to how Google Flights works for airline tickets. The platform enables businesses to compare shipping options based on price, past reliability, and service quality, making cargo transport more transparent and efficient.

## üìä About This Visualization

This repository contains an interactive timeline visualization that illustrates our project's evolution from concept to MVP, highlighting:

- Our initial vision and market research
- Technology stack decisions and architecture development
- Database migration from MongoDB to Supabase
- Our critical business pivot based on industry feedback
- Key lessons learned throughout the development process

## üîÑ The Critical Pivot

One of the most significant moments in our journey was pivoting from processing bookings directly on our platform to focusing on discovery and comparison while directing users to mediator portals for transactions. This decision was based on valuable feedback from industry professionals at Global Fillers and Consolidators, who highlighted legal complexities that would be challenging within our development timeline.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

The actual FillMyShip platform uses:
- **Frontend**: React.js with Redux for state management
- **UI**: Tailwind CSS for styling and responsive design
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth with JWT tokens
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **Cloud Hosting**: Netlify

This visualization is built with:
- React
- Tailwind CSS
- Lucide React icons

## üß† Key Learnings

Through this project, we gained valuable insights:

**Technical Insights:**
- Database selection impacts the entire development lifecycle
- Authentication flows require extensive cross-scenario testing
- Multi-level validation is essential for data integrity

**Business Insights:**
- Industry feedback is critical to avoiding legal pitfalls
- Focus on core value proposition rather than feature bloat
- Being adaptable to pivot based on market realities is crucial
